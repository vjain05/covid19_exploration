We're doing a bit of open ended exploration of the coronavirus data provided by the New York Times. (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

    1. Under an initial simplified assumption, we can see how the coronavirus infections will exponentially escalate in the near future

    2. Under a more complicated assumption, we can simulate how infections will spread and de-escalate over time. We can use this to show at a high level how government policies on social distancing can potentially affect capacity planning of our medical facilities.
